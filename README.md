**Description:**  
<p align="justify">
 The planning of raw material procurement using a forecasting method that integrates production variables, sales consumption, and raw material price trends aims to ensure optimal and efficient material availability. By projecting needs based on historical production and sales consumption data, the procurement team can predict the amount of raw materials required to support production activities without causing shortages or excess stock. Raw material price trends are also analyzed to identify purchasing opportunities when prices are competitive, helping to reduce procurement costs. This approach enables better inventory management and minimizes the risks of price fluctuations and supply disruptions.
